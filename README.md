# Projects

Here are some projects I developed, either as part of my academic work or for personal exploration:

1. Exploratory analysis and XGBoost-based prediction of mortgage loan approvals in Illinois
2. Option pricing estimate using Monte Carlo simulation method
3. Corporate credit rating prediction using multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Network
4. Stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
5. Cyclist detection using custom YOLOv8 model and pre-trained SSD MobileNetV3 model
