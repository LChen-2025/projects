# Projects

Here are some projects I developed, either as part of my academic work or for personal exploration:

1. Option pricing estimate using Monte Carlo simulation method
2. Corporate credit rating prediction using multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Network
3. Stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
4. Cyclist detection using custom YOLOv8 model and pre-trained SSD MobileNetV3 model
